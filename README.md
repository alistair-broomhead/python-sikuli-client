#sikuliserver.py
##Aka robotframework-sikuliserver
Jython script to run a robot remote library exposing the Sikuli API (and popen).
You will need Sikuli and java to already be installed.

##Under windows

Should be as simple as running sikuliserver.bat, although some variables may need changing for your installed environment

##Under OSX/Linux/Unix

Under OSX you should be able to just run sikuliserver.sh. Under other operating systems you will need to edit sikuliserver.sh to give the path where you unzipped Sikuli-IDE
